# Water_Consumption_Calculator:

This program calculates the **recommended daily water consumption** based on the **user's weight and physical activity level**. 
It follows a *specific algorithm* to determine the ideal water intake for individuals based on their weight and activity levels.

# Algorithm:

The program applies the following algorithm for calculating the recommended daily water consumption:
    
- If the weight is within the normal range, the recommended water consumption is 25-30 ml per 1 kg of body weight
- If the weight exceeds the normal range, the recommended water consumption is based on 30 ml per 1 kg of the recommended weight for overweight individuals.
- The water consumption is adjusted based on the individual's level of physical activity, allowing for a slight increase in water intake with more activity.

# Warning:
    - ❗This calculation is a recommendation❗
